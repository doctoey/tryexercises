Someone has attempted to censor my strings by replacing every vowel with a *, l*k* th*s. Luckily, I've been able to find the vowels that were removed.

Given a censored string and a string of the censored vowels, return the original uncensored string.

```js
Example:
Input: "Wh*r* d*d my v*w*ls g*?", "eeioeo" 
Output: "Where did my vowels go?"

Input: "abcd", ""
Output: "abcd"

Input: "*PP*RC*S*", "UEAE"
Output: "UPPERCASE"
```

**ยากหน่อยแต่ลองดู**
